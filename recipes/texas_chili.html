  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>This Texas chili is rich and hearty with just the right amount of heat. The beef is wonderfully tender and
    perfectly absorbs the smoky, savory seasoning of the pepper paste and spices.</p>
  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>2 ounces dried chile peppers (such as pastilla, guajillo, New Mexico chiles, and California chiles)</li>
    <li>4 cups hot water</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon finely chopped chipotle pepper in adobo sauce (about 2 peppers)</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon canola oil</li>
    <li>4 lbs boneless beef chuck roast, trimmed of excess fat, cut into 3/4-inch cubes</li>
    <li>2 teaspoons kosher salt</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
    <li>1 small chopped yellow onion</li>
    <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon ground cumin</li>
    <li>1/8 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
    <li>1 1/2 cups water, divided</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons masa harina</li>
    <li>4 cups beef stock</li>
    <li>2 bay leaves</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon white vinegar</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon dark brown sugar</li>
    <li>sour cream for serving, to taste</li>
    <li>1 lime, cut into wedges for serving</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Steps</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
    <li>Place peppers in a large skillet and heat over medium-low heat; cook, turning once, until lightly toasted and
    </li>
    <li>fragrant, 2 to 3 minutes per side. Transfer chiles to a bowl and cover with hot water; let stand for 30 minutes.
    </li>
    <li>Drain chiles, reserving about 1/2 cup of the soaking water. Use a paring knife to slice open each pepper, and
      remove and discard stems and seeds by running under a gentle stream of tap water.</li>
    <li>Combine chiles, chipotle pepper, and reserved 1/2 cup water in a blender; blend until a smooth paste forms, 15
      to 30 seconds. Set aside.</li>
    <li>Heat oil in a Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Toss beef cubes in a large bowl with salt and pepper until
      evenly coated. Add half of the beef to the Dutch oven and cook, stirring occasionally to brown most sides, about 3
      minutes per side. Transfer to a large plate. Repeat with remaining beef.</li>
    <li>Add onions and garlic to drippings in Dutch oven and cook, stirring constantly, until soft and translucent, 3 to
      4 minutes. Add cumin and cinnamon, and cook, stirring constantly, until darkened and fragrant, about 1 minute.
    </li>
    <li>Add blended chili paste and cook, stirring constantly, for 1 minute.</li>
    <li>Add 1/4 cup of the water and masa harina, whisking until incorporated to avoid lumps. Add stock and remaining 1
      1/4 cups water and stir to combine.</li>
    <li>Add bay leaves and reserved beef and bring to a simmer over medium-high. Reduce heat to maintain a very low
      simmer and cook, partially covered, stirring occasionally, until liquid is thickened, about 2 hours. Stir in brown
      sugar and vinegar.</li>
    <li>Remove from heat and let stand for 20 minutes before serving warm with sour cream and lime wedges.</li>
  </ol>
